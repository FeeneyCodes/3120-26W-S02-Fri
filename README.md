# 3120-26W-S02-Fri
In-class code for the INFO-3120 Section #2 (Friday) class

To pull this down:
1. Right-click and "git bash" where you want to place your stuff
2. Install git Large File Support with "git lfs install"
3. Clone the repo with "git clone https://github.com/FeeneyCodes/3120-26W-S02-Fri.git" 
   (the path is from the repo path with ".git" at the end)
   (**you do this only once**)
   
Then, whenever there's an update:   
1. Right-click and "git bash" where you put your stuff (the folder with the ".git" file in it)
   - If you don't see a "(main)" at the end of your path (in bash), you're in the wrong folder.
4. "git pull origin"
